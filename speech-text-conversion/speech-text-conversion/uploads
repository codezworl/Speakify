The `uploads` directory is intended to be a folder for storing uploaded files and generated audio files. Since it is a directory and not a file, it does not contain any specific contents. Therefore, the response for this request is:

# This directory is used to store uploaded files and generated audio files. It is created dynamically by the application if it does not already exist.
